Most bikes experienced trip durations in the hundred thousands. However,a few can be seen to be over 2 million.

## Summary
Based on the visualizations above, many of the customer pool comes from the female population. They are not only more likely to not only rent but also subscribe at a higher rate. It would be interesting to add one more filter to the User Trips by Gender visualization. This would allow us to see the age groups of each gender that are more likely to renting a bike. I would also like to display both Starting Station and Start Time for a count of the number of bikes being used. This would help determine exactly when and where the most bikes are being used.
